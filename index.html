<h4><li>Rani Lakshmi Bai</li></h4>
<p>No other woman warrior in the history of India has made such a powerful impact on the minds of the Indian people as the Rani of Jhansi, Lakshmi Bai. She was the second wife of the ruler of Jhansi Raja Gangadhar Rao who protested against the ‘Doctrine of Lapse’. She refused to surrender Jhansi and fought bravely attired as a male during the Revolt of 1857 and died on the battlefield fighting the British forces. Her courage inspired many Indians to rise against the alien rule.</p>

<h4><li>Sarojini Naidu</li></h4>

<p>Sarojini Naidu holds pride of place among women freedom fighters of India. She was responsible for awakening the women of India. She was the first Indian woman president of the Indian National Congress in 1925 at the Kanpur Session. In 1928, she came to the USA with the message of the nonviolence movement from Gandhiji. When in 1930, Gandhi was arrested for a protest, Sarojini took the helm of his movement. In 1931, she participated in the Round Table Summit, along with Gandhiji and Pundit Malavyaji. She was also the acting President of Congress in 1932. In 1942, she was arrested during the ‘Quit India’ protest and stayed in jail for 21 months. She was a gifted poet of the English language and was popularly known as the Nightingale of India. After independence, she became the first ever woman Governor of an Indian State (Uttar Pradesh).</p>

<h4><li>Kamla Nehru</li></h4>
<p>Kamala Nehru was the wife of one of the most notable political figures in India and the world, Jawaharlal Nehru. As the wife of one of the key figures in India's path to freedom and later the first Prime Minister of India, Kamala Nehru too had an important role to play in maintaining India's relations with the British and opposing the wrongdoings of the colonial rulers. Though brought up in a conservative family, Kamala Nehru held her own ground after she entered the Nehru family and soon emerged as a force to reckon with in the national struggle for independence.</p>
